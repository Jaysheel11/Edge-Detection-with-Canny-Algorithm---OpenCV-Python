# Edge-Detection-with-Canny-Algorithm---OpenCV-Python
Canny Edge Detection: Python script using OpenCV to detect edges in an image. Adjustable threshold values. Visualize and analyze image edges easily.


This repository contains a Python script that performs edge detection on an image using the Canny algorithm. The script utilizes the OpenCV library to read an image, apply the Canny edge detection algorithm with adjustable threshold values, and display the original image along with the resulting edge image. It provides a simple and customizable way to visualize and analyze the edges in an image.

Requirements:-
Python 3.x

OpenCV library (cv2)


How to use:-
Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
Install the required dependencies by running: pip install opencv-python.
Adjust the threshold values (t_lower and t_upper) in the script to fine-tune the edge detection.
Run the script using the command: python edge_detection.py.
The original image and the resulting edge image will be displayed in separate windows.
Press any key to close the windows and exit the program.
Feel free to use this script for various image analysis tasks that require edge detection. Experiment with different threshold values to achieve desired results. Contributions to the project are welcome.
